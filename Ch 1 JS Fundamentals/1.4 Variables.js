// -----------------Variables--------------
/*Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

1) An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
2) A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variables are used to store this information.*/


// 1> What is a variable?
/*
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
*/
//^ CODE:
        // let Message = "Hellow World"
        // alert(Message)

// Declaring Multiple Variables in ONE line
//^ CODE:
        // let name = "Faizan", age = 24, profession = "Software Engineer";

// That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

// The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:
//^ CODE:
        // let name = "Faizan";
        // let age = 25;
        // let profession = "Software Engineering";






// ============= Practice Tasks ===========================

// 1 Declare two variables: admin and name.
// 2 Assign the value "John" to name.
// 3 Copy the value from name to admin.
// 4 Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

// Solution in CODE:
                // let admin;
                // let nameVar = "John";
                // admin = nameVar;
                // alert(admin);
