// 1 ) Statements
// Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
// We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
// We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
// For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:
// CODE:
        // alert("Hellow World") ; alert("This is JS");
        
// 2 ) Semi-Colons
// A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
// This would also work:
// CODE:
//         alert("Hellow")
//         alert("World")

///! In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
// There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:
// CODE:
//         alert(3
//         + 1 
//         + 4);

// 3 ) Comments
// As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.
// Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.


        // Single Line Comment 
         alert("hello World ") //This Is An Example of Single Line Comment
        //Multi Line Comment
